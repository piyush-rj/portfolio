        I'm a fullstack web developer exploring the world of Web3. I've got a solid grip on building modern web apps from frontend to backend, and now I'm diving into blockchain tech - learning how smart contracts, decentralized apps (dApps), and crypto wallets work. Just mixing my love for clean UIs with the future of the internet.
